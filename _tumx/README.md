# Tmux Workflow
This is my simple tmux workflow for backend devlopment and other personal projects.

# Requirements
 - `fzf` : fuzzy finder.
 - `tmux`: terminal muliplexer.

# Usage
It's a simple script that searches for a project inside a certain path, creates a `tmux session` and runs some commands :)

Make sure to edit the path `projects="/path/to/projects"`, `no` for not nodejs.

	- chmod +x tmux-dev.sh
	- ./tmux-dev.sh no
